        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
          We are a non-profit review webpage for almost all existing Monster
          energy flavours sold in Sweden. Here you'll find information about how
          the varioud flavours taste, how refreshing they are, in what
          situations they are perfect to drink and more. If you want to get
          started, check out our various reviews which are linked to at the top
          of our page!

        <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike other reviewers that you may find online, our review team is
          carefully picked out who has established themselves as taste critics
          for items such as snacks and refreshments. All reviews that are
          performed are organized to make sure all participants agree with each
          other on their collective conclusion about said flavor. (No we are
          definietly not like 3 teens who drink way too much monster)
